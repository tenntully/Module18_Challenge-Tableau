Notes: 
1) All analysis and description is included in the story board at that top of the page.
2) Data used was for one week in April 2023 due to size constraints.  Data was simply sorted and manually deleted using Excel.  
3) Code to integrate zip code data was written to pull geocode data using multiple API sources (geoapify and google maps) however I was afraid of getting charged for all of the data (about 1700 station names).  This was not included but the Jupyter Notebook code remains in the repo.
